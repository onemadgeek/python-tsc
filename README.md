# Python TypeScript Compiler 🐍➞💜

Ever looked at the blazing-fast, well-optimized TypeScript compiler and thought, **"This is great, but what if it were slower and written in Python?"** Well, congratulations! 🎉 You've found **Python-TSC**, the TypeScript-to-JavaScript compiler that *absolutely nobody asked for*.

## 💥 What is this?
This is a **TypeScript-to-JavaScript compiler** written in Python. Because why use the perfectly good TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) when you can make your life *way harder*? 


Ever looked at the blazing-fast, well-optimized TypeScript compiler and thought,  
*"Nah, I need something slower, more cursed, and written in Python"*?  

Well, congratulations! 🎉 You've found **Python-TSC**, the *definitive* TypeScript-to-JavaScript compiler that nobody asked for.  

### What does it do?  
- 👉 **Transpiles TypeScript to JavaScript** (but, like, in Python)
- ✅ Parses TypeScript (kinda)
- 👉 **Ignores actual TypeScript features for MAXIMUM EFFICIENCY**
- ✅ Tokenizes TypeScript (because we can)
- 👉 **Replaces `let x: number = 42;` with `let x = 42;` (groundbreaking, we know)**
- ✅ Ignores all the hard stuff, like actual TypeScript features 😆

## Who is this for?  
- People who love Python *too much*  
- TypeScript haters who want revenge  
- Developers who enjoy unnecessary suffering  

## 😬 Installation
### 1️⃣ Clone this masterpiece
```bash
git clone https://github.com/onemadgeek/python-tsc.git
cd python-tsc
```
### 2️⃣ Install dependencies (there are none!)
```bash
pip install nothing  # Because we keep things lightweight
```
### 3️⃣ Run it
```bash
python compiler.py example.ts
```

## 🌟 Example Usage
### Input (`example.ts`)
```ts
let age: number = 25;
const message: string = "Hello, world!";
console.log(message, "You are", age, "years old.");
```

### Output (JavaScript)
```js
let age = 25;
const message = "Hello, world!";
console.log(message, "You are", age, "years old.");
```

## 🤔 But... why?
- Because Python can (but probably shouldn't)
- Because TypeScript fans need to suffer
- Because normal compilers are *too fast*
- Because we *can*

## 😂 FAQ
**Q: Is this production-ready?**  
A: Absolutely! Just like JavaScript is a *real* programming language.

**Q: Will this replace TypeScript's official compiler?**  
A: Yes, the moment pigs learn to code.

**Q: Can I use this in my startup?**  
A: Only if you *want* investors to run away.
