# python-tsc
A *blazing-fast* (lol, no) TypeScript-to-JavaScript compiler written in Pythonâ€”because why not? ðŸš€ Parses TypeScript (kinda), transpiles it (barely), and ignores all the hard stuff. Perfect for people who love Python *way too much* or just enjoy unnecessary suffering. Star this if you, too, make questionable life choices. ðŸ˜†ðŸ”¥
